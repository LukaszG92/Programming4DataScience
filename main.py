"""
In natural language processing, a common preprocessing step is removing stopwords from text data.
Stopwords are words that are considered to be of little value in text analysis because they are very common and don't carry much meaning (e.g., "the," "and," "in").
In this exercise, you will write a Python program to implement a simple stopwords list and use it to filter out stopwords from a given text.
        1. Create a list of stopwords containing common words (e.g., "the," "and," "in").
           You can choose to include more stopwords if you like.
        2. Write a Python program that takes a sentence or a paragraph of text as input from the user.
        3. Tokenize the input text into words (split by whitespace).
        4. Remove any stopwords from the list of words.
        5. Print the filtered list of words, which should exclude the stopwords.
